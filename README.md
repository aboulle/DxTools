# DxTools
Processing XRD data files recorded with the Bruker D8 diffractometer

## Supported file formats
For the moment, DxTools suppports Bruker's uxd and brml file formats.
## Features
DxTools automates data formating for most major laboratory XRD experiments:
- Reciprocal space maps: in the (Qx,Qz) plane recorded with the 1D Lynxeye detector,
or recorded with a series of 2\theta/\theta scans with varying offset;
in the (Qx,Qy) plane recorded with a series of rocking-curves/\omega-scans at varying \phi angles.

- Temperature experiments
